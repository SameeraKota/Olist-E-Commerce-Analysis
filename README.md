## Key Insights:

1. Maximum orders are placed between March to August(60.38K) because of which sales during this month are higher($8.34M) which is 61.36% of total sales. Which shows that the store is performing well during this month.
2. Currently credit cards are the most preferred payment type by customers which contributes a major role in overall sales(78.44%). To improve sales & to promote other payment types, Olist Store can provide discounts & offers on other payment types.
3. Olist Store needs to work more during the last quarter to improve the sales as there are less orders placed during September to December months which also results in less average review score. Store needs to focus on advertisement & different offers on products during the period.
4. Maximum customer crowd is from Sao Paulo & Eastern side of the country as compared to other regions. To improve the sales in other regions stores need to focus on campaign & promotion in these regions.
5. After observing the comment section we got to know that Bed bath table, health beauty, sports leisure, furniture decor, computer accessories, housewares & watches gifts are the products which receive maximum of the recommendation from customers with average review score 4.08 which shows these are most demanding products among the customers.
6. From 5th KPI we can conclude that if sellers take longer days to deliver the product then customers provide less review score which shows it is one the factor that influences review score.
7. Sellers should improve on delivery days & should keep customers informed about status of delivery it will make time go much faster for customer and will create personalize experience because they know what's happening.
